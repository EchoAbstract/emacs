#+TITLE: Brian Wilson's emacs config
#+AUTHOR: Brian Wilson <polytopes@gmail.com>

This is Brian's emacs config, it's geared towards my specific use cases, in
particular:


- I'm a C++ programmer in my day job for [[https://www.oblong.com/][Oblong Industries]]
  - I also use Python, JS, TypeScript, and HTML regularly
- I heavily use both linux and mac, but I cut my teeth on *BSD distributions
- Outside of work I use C++, C, Ada, Go, Julia, Python, and JS/HTML
- Despite my initial resistence to it, I'm a git convert and use it for
  everything
- While I'd like to use org-mode more, compatibility forces me to focus more
  on markdown
- I really like scheme and lisp, but can't really justify major focus on them,
  hwoever slime, geiser, and lisp machines have really influenced how I develop
- I used to use emacs for everything, including mail and newsreading, but
  gmail is somewhat difficult to use with emacs so I don't do that much
  anymore :-(
- Finally, I keep work specific code in a separate repo and load it on-demand
  based on if that repo is present

If any of this sounds useful, read on!


* Platform Support

* Major Modes

** C/C++

*** Code Completion (RTags)

I use [[https://github.com/Andersbakken/rtags][RTags]] for most code completion paired with company-mode for code
completion.  I've had a difficult time with Homebrew on mac breaking my RTags
setup many times so currently I do the following steps:

1. Download an [[https://llvm.org/][LLVM]] release to ~${HOME}/LLVM/clang+llvm-<version>-<platform>~
2. Clone RTags to ~${HOME}/src~ and build pointing to the downloaded LLVM (in
   the below example I'm using LLVM 5.0.1 on macOS)
   1. ~LLVMDIR=${HOME}/LLVM~
   2. ~mkdir -p ${LLVMDIR}~
   3. ~cd ${LLVMDIR}~
   4. ~tar tf ${HOME}/Downloads/clang+llvm-5.0.1-x86_64-apple-darwin.tar.xz~
   5. ~mkdir ${HOME}/src~
   6. ~cd ${HOME}/src~
   7. ~git clone --recursive https://github.com/Andersbakken/rtags.git~
   8. ~mkdir build && cd build~
   9. ~LIBCLANG_LLVM_CONFIG_EXECUTABLE=${LLVMDIR}/clang+llvm-5.0.1-final-x86_64-apple-darwin/bin/llvm-config cmake -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=1 -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=${HOME}/.local -GNinja ..~
   10. ~ninja -j4 install~
3. Configure RDM to run automatically
   - [[file:~/src/rtags/README.org::*Integration%20with%20%3Dlaunchd%3D%20/(Mac%20OS%20X)/][macOS Instructions]]
   - [[file:~/src/rtags/README.org::*Integration%20with%20%3Dsystemd%3D%20/(GNU%20Linux)/][linux instructions]]

*** Other notes

I like bright output in compilation, so I colorize the compilation output, and
I jump to the end (which is great if there's a small number of errors, but
terrible if there is a large number of errors.

I also force ~subword-mode~, as I code with case.

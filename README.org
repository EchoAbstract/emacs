#+TITLE: Brian Wilson's emacs config
#+AUTHOR: Brian Wilson <polytopes@gmail.com>

This is Brian's emacs config, it's geared towards my specific use cases, in
particular:


- I'm a C++/Web programmer in my day job for [[https://www.oblong.com/][Oblong Industries]]
  - I also use Python, React, and Electron
- I heavily use both linux, mac, and windows... but I cut my teeth on *BSD distributions
- Outside of work I use C++, C, Ada, Go, Julia, Python, and JS/HTML
- Despite my initial resistence to it, I'm a git convert and use it for
  everything
- While I'd like to use org-mode more, compatibility forces me to focus more
  on markdown
- I really like scheme and lisp, but can't really justify major focus on them,
  hwoever slime, geiser, and lisp machines have really influenced how I develop
- I used to use emacs for everything, including mail and newsreading, but
  gmail is somewhat difficult to use with emacs so I don't do that much
  anymore :-(
- Finally, I keep work specific code in a separate repo and load it on-demand
  based on if that repo is present

If any of this sounds useful, read on!


* External Dependencies

** LSP

These are needed for LSP modes:

- bash :: ~npm i -g bash-language-server~
- CSS :: ~npm install -g vscode-css-languageserver-bin~
- HTML :: ~npm install -g vscode-html-languageserver-bin~
- Typescript :: ~npm i -g typescript-language-server; npm i -g typescript~
- VUE :: ~npm install -g vue-language-server~
- Python :: ~pip install 'python-language-server[all]'~
- cquery :: https://github.com/cquery-project/cquery
- Go :: https://github.com/saibing/bingo/wiki/Install

** Go

These need to be evaluated based on the LSP support
- ~go get -u golang.org/x/tools/cmd/...~
- godef :: ~go get -u github.com/rogpeppe/godef/...~
- ~go get -u github.com/nsf/gocode~
- goimports :: ~go get -u golang.org/x/tools/cmd/goimports~
- guru :: ~go get -u golang.org/x/tools/cmd/guru~
- flymake :: ~go get -u github.com/dougm/goflymake~



* Platform Support

** Windows

I've found that having certain unicode chars in the mode line causes all
updates on windows to be really slow, so I've removed my usage of those chars.

* Major Modes

** C/C++

*** Other notes

I like bright output in compilation, so I colorize the compilation output, and
I jump to the end (which is great if there's a small number of errors, but
terrible if there is a large number of errors.

I also force ~subword-mode~, as I code with case.

** Go

*** Dependencies

- ~go get -u golang.org/x/tools/cmd/...~
- ~go get -u github.com/rogpeppe/godef/...~
- ~go get -u github.com/nsf/gocode~
- ~go get -u golang.org/x/tools/cmd/goimports~
- ~go get -u golang.org/x/tools/cmd/guru~
- ~go get -u github.com/dougm/goflymake~
